# PG_interface_docs
Documentation towards developing a uniform interface to the PG renderer. 

1. Where possible upload documents using github markdown
2. To make substantial changes to a document use the procedure we use for modifying webwork code:
  a. Clone this repos to your own github account
  b. Make changes on your github account (either via the web, or as a push from modifications you have made from a clone on your desktop.)
  c. Submit a pull request from the repos on your github account to the PG_interface_docs repos on github.com/openwebwork
1. This way we will have a record of major changes, will have a chance to comment on changes before they are accepted (merged) and will better be able to trace the history leading up to the final document.
2. Unlike code where we discourage people from merging their own pull requests we will relax that here.  Use your judgement. If it's been a few days since you submitted a PR and you don't think its controversial go ahead and merge your own PR.
3. For minor, non-substantial corrections you can make the changes from the web without creating a pull request. Use your judgement.
4. Most people actively involved should have commit privileges on this repo. Ask to join the PG_interfac_docs team if you don't.
